# Sales Rep Workload, Retention & Client Experience Dashboard

![Sales Rep Workload Dashboard](./Sales%20Rep%20Workload%20Dashboard.jpeg)

## Overview
This project explores the connection between sales rep workload, employee retention, and client satisfaction in a fintech sales environment. Using simulated data, I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the impact of workload on rep status and client experience.

## Key Insights
- High lead volume does not always result in lower client satisfaction. In this sample, Sales Rep #1 and #3 handle the heaviest workloads yet maintain the highest satisfaction scores.
- Rep #2 is an outlier, showing that even with the lowest workload, client satisfaction can lag behind—highlighting the need for targeted coaching or support.
- Individual skill, experience, and strategies appear to play a significant role in both workload management and client experience.
- Understanding and replicating the best practices of top performers could benefit the whole team.

## Additional Insights
- The relationship between lead volume and client satisfaction is not linear. Some reps (like those on the right of the plot) maintain high satisfaction despite heavy workloads, while others with lighter loads report lower satisfaction.
- Top performers can excel under pressure. Reps with both high lead averages and high client satisfaction show that individual skill, support, or strategy makes a major difference.

## Recommendations
- Regularly analyze and balance rep workloads to prevent burnout.
- Proactively support and coach at-risk reps, regardless of workload size.
- Recognize and replicate the strategies of high-performing reps to boost overall satisfaction and retention.

## Why This Matters
A nuanced, data-driven approach to workload and team management can lead to stronger sales teams and happier clients. This project demonstrates my ability to challenge assumptions, spot outliers, and turn analytics into action.
