# Sales Rep Workload, Retention & Client Experience Dashboard

![Sales Rep Workload Dashboard](./Sales%20Rep%20Workload%20Dashboard.jpeg)

## Overview
This project analyzes sales rep workload and its relationship to employee retention and client satisfaction in a fintech sales context. Using simulated data, I built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the connections between rep status, workload, and client outcomes.

## Key Insights
- High lead volume does not always result in lower client satisfaction. Some reps thrive under pressure while others need additional support.
- Outliers in the data show that even with the lowest workload, some reps may struggle with client satisfaction—suggesting the need for personalized coaching.
- The relationship between lead volume and satisfaction is not linear; sharing best practices from top performers can improve team results.

## Recommendations
- Regularly analyze and balance rep workloads to prevent burnout.
- Proactively support and coach at-risk reps, regardless of workload size.
- Recognize and replicate the strategies of high-performing reps to boost overall satisfaction and retention.

## Why This Matters
A nuanced, data-driven approach to workload and team management can lead to stronger sales teams and happier clients. This project demonstrates my ability to challenge assumptions, spot outliers, and turn analytics into action.
